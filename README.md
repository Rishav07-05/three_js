# Introduction ☄️
Three.js is an open-source JavaScript library that allows you to create 3D graphics in your browser with ease. It provides a robust set of tools for developers to build interactive 3D environments, games, data visualizations, and more.

# Getting Started
To get started with Three.js, you'll need to include the library in your project. You can do this by using a CDN or by downloading the library and including it in your project directory.

# Basic Concepts
In this section, we cover the fundamental concepts of Three.js, including:

Scene: The container for all your 3D objects, lights, and cameras.
Camera: Defines the viewer's perspective.
Renderer: Renders the scene from the perspective of the camera.
Mesh: A combination of geometry (shape) and material (appearance).
Light: Illuminates the objects in the scene.

# Intermediate Topics
Building upon the basics, this section explores more advanced features:

Textures and Materials: Applying textures, creating different materials.
Animations: Basic animation loops, keyframe animations.
Shadows and Lighting: Adding realism with shadows and advanced lighting techniques.
Controls: Implementing user interactions, such as orbit controls.

# Advanced Techniques
For those looking to dive deeper, this section covers:

Shaders: Writing custom vertex and fragment shaders.
Post-processing: Adding effects like bloom, depth of field, and more.
Physics Integration: Using libraries like Cannon.js for physics simulations.
Performance Optimization: Techniques for optimizing render performance.
# Examples
Explore a collection of examples demonstrating various features of Three.js:

Basic Scene: A simple scene with a cube and a point light.
Texture Mapping: Applying textures to 3D objects.
Animating a Mesh: Basic animation example.
Custom Shaders: Example of custom shaders for unique visual effects.
